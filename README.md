# REST-API Node.js

This REST API Node.js project provides basic functionality for managing products. It is built with Node.js and uses the following dependencies: cors, express, lodash, and uuid.

The API supports the following HTTP methods for managing products:

GET: retrieves all products or a specific product by ID
POST: creates a new product
PUT: updates an existing product by ID
DELETE: deletes a product by ID
The project uses Express to set up the server and handle incoming requests. CORS is used to allow cross-origin requests. Lodash is used for data manipulation, and UUID is used to generate unique IDs for new products.

The API can be tested using a tool like Insomnia, which can send HTTP requests and receive responses. The project includes a set of Insomnia requests that can be used to test the API. These requests include creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting products.

In summary, this project provides a simple REST API for managing products and demonstrates the use of popular Node.js libraries for server-side development.
